# Exploding Totems Champion

Exploding Totems is the strongest build in the Crucible league. While most people would create a Pathfinder for the poison variant, I decided to do Champion.

Note: A lot of the gear are cobbled together and not at all finalized.

## Build Mechanics
Crucible league introduced adding passive trees to weapons and shields. Among the passives are special passivesthat interact with specific skill gems. The main Crucible passive that we are focusing on is "Totems Explode on Death, dealing 600% of their Life as Physical Damage".

Totems have a cap on the number of totems can be summoned, and newer instances will despawn the oldest totems. These old totems are considered "killed" when that happens, and will trigger the Crucible passive that we are utilizing. 

We link _Devouring Totem_ to Trap Support, which allows us to summon a _Devouring Totem_ when a monster triggers our thrown trap. Adding Cluster Trap Support and Multiple Trap Support allows us to increase the number of traps we throw from a single cast of the ability, so that more totems explode per trap throw.

Finally, we scale our base damage with "Gain Physical damage as Extra Chaos Damage" and getting 100% poison chance so that we will poison our enemies with each totem explosion. The huge amount of chaos damage scaled from totem life and multiple stacks applied means that we will deal an extreme amount of poison damage - both in terms of damage per poison instance and the stack scaling.

## Offensive Mechanics
To scale the base damage of the explosions, we need to scale the base life of the totems. That requires either skill tree passives or levels on the _Devouring Totem_ gem. 
- For skill tree passives, we take the left side of the Totem cluster by Iron Reflexes. We also anoint Primal Manifestation.
- We have a 21/20 _Devouring Totem_ linked with Empower Support, socketed in a "+1 to level of socketed gems"/"+2 to level of socketed support gems" bow. Our amulet also gives "+1 to Level of All Skill Gems".

To increase the number of totems, we are utilizing another Crucible passive "Skills that would Summon a Totem have 50% chance to Summon two Totems instead". This is also present as a totem mastery. In total we have 80% chance to summon two totems instead of one. On average we are throwing 9 totems per trap throw.

A _Glorious Vanity_ timeless jewel can give the passive 25% chance to inflict Withered for 2 seconds on Hit. This allows us to apply Withered stacks beyond the 6 that comes with Withering Step.

_Ming's Heart_ gives us massive damage at the cost of reducing our Life and Energy shield.

We utilize two curses: _Despair_ and _Temporal Chain_. Both increase our damage.
## Defensive Mechanics
We are using _The Fourth Vow_ in conjunction with _Divine Flesh_ for scaling our defenses relative to our _Chaos Resistance_. _The Fourth Vow_ allows armour to become a mitigating factor in chaos hits, while _Divine Flesh_ converts a portion of the elemental damage you take into chaos hits, as well as raising the maximum amount of _Chaos Resistance_ to 80%.

Champion comes with a huge amount of damage reduction from the ascendancy. We are stun-immune, take 20% less damage, and have 10% additional physical damage reduction from Adrenaline.

The large amount of armour and evasion we get from the ascendancy and gear is scaled heavily by Determination and Grace. We have capped _Physical Reduction_, as well as ~80% evasion chance.

Gear and Tree will give us capped suppression.

From our pathing and gear choices, we have a non-insignificant amount of life regeneration as well as life leech.

## QOL/Misc
We use _Plague Bearer_ to improve our clear, as we lack Pathfinder's _Master Toxicist_ for poison proliferation.

_Discipline_ will add to the ES pool. Without Discipline, you will have ~300 Energy shield, while _Discipline_ will give you roughly 800-1000 ES.


## Improvements to Builds
One can get a bow with better Crucible Tree. For instance, the higher tier of "Skills that would Summon a Totem have 70% chance to Summon two Totems instead" would guarantee 2 totems per trigger. Additionally, there are other passives that one can consider for the tree.

The _Watcher's Eye_ is extremely flexible in terms of what mods it can utilize, so long as you are using a corresponding aura.

If one doesn't care about the damage from an amulet, _Aul's Uprising_ is an amulet that lets you fit one more aura in. Typically it would be Purity of Elements, as that gives you more flexibility on gear with regards to resistances, as well as give immunity to elemental ailments.

The current POB shows 99% spell suppression. 100% can be reached with better dexterity rolls on gear.

The belt can be enchanted with "+300 to Armour while Fortified" or "Enemies Withered by you have -6% to all Resistances".
