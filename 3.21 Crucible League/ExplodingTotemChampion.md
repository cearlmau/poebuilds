# Exploding Totems Champion

Exploding Totems is the strongest build in the Crucible league. While most people would create a Pathfinder for the poison variant, I decided to do champion.


## Build Mechanics
Crucible league introduced adding passive trees to weapons and shields. Among the passives are special passivesthat interact with specific skill gems. The main Crucible passive that we are focusing on is "Totems Explode on Death, dealing 600% of their Life as Physical Damage".

Totems have a cap on the number of totems can be summoned, and newer instances will despawn the oldest totems. These old totems are considered "killed" when that happens, and will trigger the Crucible passive that we are utilizing. 

We link Devouring Totem to Trap Support, which allows us to summon a Devouring Totem when a monster triggers our thrown trap. Adding Cluster Trap Support and Multiple Trap Support allows us to increase the number of traps we throw from a single cast of the ability, so that more totems explode per trap throw.

Finally, we scale our base damage with "gain physical damage as extra chaos damage" and getting 100% poison chance so that we will poison our enemies with each totem explosion. 

## Offensive Mechanics
To scale the base damage of the explosions, we need to scale the base life of the totems. That requires either skill tree passives or levels on the Devouring Totem gem. 
- For skill tree passives, we take the left side of the Totem cluster by Iron Reflexes. We also anoint Primal Manifestation.
- We have a 21/20 Devouring Totem linked with Empower Support, socketed in a "+1 to level of socketed gems"/"+2 to level of socketed support gems" bow. Our amulet also gives "+1 to level of all skill gems".

To increase the number of totems, we are utilizing another Crucible passive "Skills that would Summon a Totem have 50% chance to Summon two Totems instead". This is also present as a totem mastery. In total we have 80% chance to summon two totems instead of one. On average we are throwing 9 totems per trap throw.

A Glorious Vanity timeless jewel can give the passive 25% chance to inflict Withered for 2 seconds on Hit. This allows us to apply Withered stacks beyond the 6 that comes with Withering Step.
